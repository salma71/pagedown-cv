This repository has different versions of my resume, with the paged versions created with [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) (NOTE: for now 1 and 2 only works properly in Chrome, as some aspects of CSS Paged Media are only supported by this browser):


The resum√©s pull in different subsets of cv entries that live in two separate Excel files on my machine (one for projects, one for all other cv entries).
