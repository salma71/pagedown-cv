# Summary

I am passionate about using insights from the behavioural neurosciences to **design digital technology that is sensitive to human limitations and biases**, particularly in relation to attention and self-regulation.

My **academic and professional background** is highly interdisciplinary, and I try to integrate best practices from many work spheres, such as using tools from large-scale event management to structure academic projects.

My **personal interests** include travelling & couchsurfing, samatha meditation, dancing (Cuban salsa and swing), and playing music (whatever instruments I can get my hands on, and ideally with the [Karaoke Collective](https://karaokecollective.com)).
